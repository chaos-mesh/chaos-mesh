                          StressngStressors defines plenty of stressors just like `Stressors` except that it's an experimental
                          feature and more powerful. You can define stressors in `stress-ng` (see also `man stress-ng`) dialect,
                          however not all of the supported stressors are well tested. It maybe retired in later releases. You
                          should always use `Stressors` to define the stressors and use this only when you want more stressors
                          unsupported by `Stressors`. When both `StressngStressors` and `Stressors` are defined, `StressngStressors`
                          wins.

                                            and the each values is a set of pod names.

                                        StressngStressors defines plenty of stressors just like `Stressors` except that it's an experimental
                                        feature and more powerful. You can define stressors in `stress-ng` (see also `man stress-ng`) dialect,
                                        however not all of the supported stressors are well tested. It maybe retired in later releases. You
                                        should always use `Stressors` to define the stressors and use this only when you want more stressors
                                        unsupported by `Stressors`. When both `StressngStressors` and `Stressors` are defined, `StressngStressors`
                                        wins.

                                            PreStop is called immediately before a container is terminated due to an
                                            API request or management event such as liveness/startup probe failure,
                                            preemption, resource contention, etc. The handler is not called if the
                                            container crashes or exits. The Pod's termination grace period countdown begins before the
                                            PreStop hook is executed. Regardless of the outcome of the handler, the
                                            container will eventually terminate within the Pod's termination grace
                                            period (unless delayed by finalizers). Other management of the container blocks until the hook completes
                                            or until the termination grace period is reached.

                                        RestartPolicy defines the restart behavior of individual containers in a pod.
                                        This field may only be set for init containers, and the only allowed value is "Always".
                                        For non-init containers or when this field is not specified,
                                        the restart behavior is defined by the Pod's restart policy and the container type.
                                        Setting the RestartPolicy as "Always" for the init container will have the following effect:
                                        this init container will be continually restarted on
                                        exit until all regular containers have terminated. Once all regular
                                        containers have completed, all init containers with restartPolicy "Always"
                                        will be shut down. This lifecycle differs from normal init containers and
                                        is often referred to as a "sidecar" container. Although this init
                                        container still starts in the init container sequence, it does not wait
                                        for the container to complete before proceeding to the next init
                                        container. Instead, the next init container starts immediately after this
                                        init container is started, or after any startupProbe has successfully
                                        completed.

                                        description: |-
                                          ephemeral represents a volume that is handled by a cluster storage driver.
                                          The volume's lifecycle is tied to the pod that defines it - it will be created before the pod starts,
                                          and deleted when the pod is removed.


                                          Use this if:
                                          a) the volume is only needed while the pod runs,
                                          b) features of normal volumes like restoring from snapshot or capacity
                                             tracking are needed,
                                          c) the storage driver is specified through a storage class, and
                                          d) the storage driver supports dynamic volume provisioning through
                                             a PersistentVolumeClaim (see EphemeralVolumeSource for more
                                             information on the connection between this volume type
                                             and PersistentVolumeClaim).


                                          Use PersistentVolumeClaim or one of the vendor-specific
                                          APIs for volumes that persist for longer than the lifecycle
                                          of an individual pod.


                                          Use CSI for light-weight local ephemeral volumes if the CSI driver is meant to
                                          be used that way - see the documentation of the driver for
                                          more information.


                                          A pod can use both types of ephemeral volumes and
                                          persistent volumes at the same time.
                                        properties:
                                          volumeClaimTemplate:

                                              Will be used to create a stand-alone PVC to provision the volume.
                                              The pod in which this EphemeralVolumeSource is embedded will be the
                                              owner of the PVC, i.e. the PVC will be deleted together with the
                                              pod.  The name of the PVC will be `<pod name>-<volume name>` where
                                              `<volume name>` is the name from the `PodSpec.Volumes` array
                                              entry. Pod validation will reject the pod if the concatenated name
                                              is not valid for a PVC (for example, too long).


                                              An existing PVC with that name that is not owned by the pod
                                              will *not* be used for the pod to avoid using an unrelated
                                              volume by mistake. Starting the pod is then blocked until
                                              the unrelated PVC is removed. If such a pre-created PVC is
                                              meant to be used by the pod, the PVC has to updated with an
                                              owner reference to the pod once the pod exists. Normally
                                              this should not be necessary, but it may be useful when
                                              manually reconstructing a broken cluster.

                                                      dataSourceRef specifies the object from which to populate the volume with data, if a non-empty
                                                      volume is desired. This may be any object from a non-empty API group (non

                                                      This field will replace the functionality of the dataSource field and as such
                                                      if both fields are non-empty, they must have the same value. For backwards
                                                      compatibility, when namespace isn't specified in dataSourceRef,
                                                      both fields (dataSource and dataSourceRef) will be set to the same
                                                      value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty.
                                                      When namespace is specified in dataSourceRef,
                                                      dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty.
                                                      There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                                                      * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
                                                        allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                                                      * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
                                                        preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                                                        specified.
                                                      * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
                                                        in any namespaces.
                                                      (Beta) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.
                                                      (Alpha) Using the namespace field of dataSourceRef requires the CrossNamespaceVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.

                              PreStop hook is executed. Regardless of the outcome of the handler, the
                              container will eventually terminate within the Pod's termination grace
                              period (unless delayed by finalizers). Other management of the container blocks until the hook completes
                              or until the termination grace period is reached.

                          RestartPolicy defines the restart behavior of individual containers in a pod.
                          This field may only be set for init containers, and the only allowed value is "Always".
                          For non-init containers or when this field is not specified,
                          the restart behavior is defined by the Pod's restart policy and the container type.
                          Setting the RestartPolicy as "Always" for the init container will have the following effect:
                          this init container will be continually restarted on
                          exit until all regular containers have terminated. Once all regular
                          containers have completed, all init containers with restartPolicy "Always"
                          will be shut down. This lifecycle differs from normal init containers and
                          is often referred to as a "sidecar" container. Although this init
                          container still starts in the init container sequence, it does not wait
                          for the container to complete before proceeding to the next init
                          container. Instead, the next init container starts immediately after this
                          init container is started, or after any startupProbe has successfully
                          completed.

                          description: |-
                            ephemeral represents a volume that is handled by a cluster storage driver.
                            The volume's lifecycle is tied to the pod that defines it - it will be created before the pod starts,
                            and deleted when the pod is removed.


                            Use this if:
                            a) the volume is only needed while the pod runs,
                            b) features of normal volumes like restoring from snapshot or capacity
                               tracking are needed,
                            c) the storage driver is specified through a storage class, and
                            d) the storage driver supports dynamic volume provisioning through
                               a PersistentVolumeClaim (see EphemeralVolumeSource for more
                               information on the connection between this volume type
                               and PersistentVolumeClaim).


                            Use PersistentVolumeClaim or one of the vendor-specific
                            APIs for volumes that persist for longer than the lifecycle
                            of an individual pod.


                            Use CSI for light-weight local ephemeral volumes if the CSI driver is meant to
                            be used that way - see the documentation of the driver for
                            more information.


                            A pod can use both types of ephemeral volumes and
                            persistent volumes at the same time.

                                Will be used to create a stand-alone PVC to provision the volume.
                                The pod in which this EphemeralVolumeSource is embedded will be the
                                owner of the PVC, i.e. the PVC will be deleted together with the
                                pod.  The name of the PVC will be `<pod name>-<volume name>` where
                                `<volume name>` is the name from the `PodSpec.Volumes` array
                                entry. Pod validation will reject the pod if the concatenated name
                                is not valid for a PVC (for example, too long).


                                An existing PVC with that name that is not owned by the pod
                                will *not* be used for the pod to avoid using an unrelated
                                volume by mistake. Starting the pod is then blocked until
                                the unrelated PVC is removed. If such a pre-created PVC is
                                meant to be used by the pod, the PVC has to updated with an
                                owner reference to the pod once the pod exists. Normally
                                this should not be necessary, but it may be useful when
                                manually reconstructing a broken cluster.

                                        volume is desired. This may be any object from a non-empty API group (non
                                        core object) or a PersistentVolumeClaim object.
                                        When this field is specified, volume binding will only succeed if the type of

                                        compatibility, when namespace isn't specified in dataSourceRef,
                                        both fields (dataSource and dataSourceRef) will be set to the same
                                        value automatically if one of them is empty and the other is non-empty.
                                        When namespace is specified in dataSourceRef,
                                        dataSource isn't set to the same value and must be empty.
                                        There are three important differences between dataSource and dataSourceRef:
                                        * While dataSource only allows two specific types of objects, dataSourceRef
                                          allows any non-core object, as well as PersistentVolumeClaim objects.
                                        * While dataSource ignores disallowed values (dropping them), dataSourceRef
                                          preserves all values, and generates an error if a disallowed value is
                                          specified.
                                        * While dataSource only allows local objects, dataSourceRef allows objects
                                          in any namespaces.
                                        (Beta) Using this field requires the AnyVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.
                                        (Alpha) Using the namespace field of dataSourceRef requires the CrossNamespaceVolumeDataSource feature gate to be enabled.
