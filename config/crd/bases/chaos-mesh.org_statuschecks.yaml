              duration:

                  Duration defines the duration of the whole status check if the
                  number of failed execution does not exceed the failure threshold.
                  Duration is available to both `Synchronous` and `Continuous` mode.
                  A duration string is a possibly signed sequence of
                  decimal numbers, each with optional fraction and a unit suffix,
                  such as "300ms", "-1.5h" or "2h45m".
                  Valid time units are "ns", "us" (or "Âµs"), "ms", "s", "m", "h".
