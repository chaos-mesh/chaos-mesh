# chaosctl

Chaosctl is a tool (currently) used to print debug info. Maintainers would make use of it to better provide their suggestions for issues.

## How to build

```shell
cd $CHAOSMESH_DIR
make chaosctl
./bin/chaosctl --help # to see if build succeeds.
```

Chaoctl supports shell autocompletion, which could save you some typing. Do `./bin/chaosctl completion -h` for detail.

## How to use

**Debug**

`chaoctl debug` is used to print debug info of certain chaos. Currently, it supports **networkchaos**, **stresschaos** and **iochaos**.

```shell
# To print info of each networkchaos
./bin/chaosctl debug networkchaos
# To print info of certain chaos in default namespace
./bin/chaosctl debug networkchaos CHAOSNAME
# To print info of each networkchaos in certain namespace
./bin/chaosctl debug networkchaos -n NAMESPACE
```

**Logs**

`chaoctl logs` is used to easily print log from all chaos-mesh components, including controller-manager, chaos-daemon and chaos-dashboard.

```shell
# Default print all log of all chaosmesh components
./bin/chaosctl logs

# To print 100 log lines for chaosmesh components in node NODENAME
./bin/chaosctl logs -t 100 -n NODENAME
```

## Detail of `debug`

An example output structure of `debug` would be like:

```
CHAOSNAME
PODNAME (which the chaos would take effect on)
    DEBUG_INFO
PODNAME
    DEBUG_INFO
```

The `DEBUG_INFO` of each supported chaos would be:

​ NetworkChaos:

1. `ipset list` of chaos daemon
2. `tc qdisc list`
3. `iptables list`
4. podnetworkchaos spec

​ StressChaos:

1. `ps` of target pod
2. `cat /proc/${PID}/cgroup` of each process
3. `cat /proc/${stress-ng_PID}/cgroup`
4. the actual `cpu`/`memory` limit, compared with the set value

​ IOChaos:

1. `cat /proc/mounts` of target pod
2. `ls -l /proc/${PID}/fd`
